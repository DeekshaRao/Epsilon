1) Assignment folder consist of three subfolders
        a) Part A- Card Component (Output: run the html file)
        b) Part B- Form Elements  (Output: run the html file)
        c) Part C- Table Functions

2) There is an another folder which is a fontFamily folder, for all the three parts of the application, I have used the same folder.

3) For the third part of the assignment, I have created angular project called tableFunctions the code inside the route [app/components/table](path: ''), I have used angular pipe for sorting the table
and for the route [app/components/table-without-pipe](path: '/table'), I have not used any library for sorting the table, the sort of the table works on click of icon.
Run: ng serve
